                        <h3>Our beliefs</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>We believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Saviour (Acts 10:36, Rome 10:9-11, 1. John 4:14)
                            and that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life.
                            He is the Only way, no one can come to the Father except through Him.(John 14:6)
                            Therefore we believe in the Trinity (God the Father, the Son & the Holy Spirit)<br>
                            We believe that the Bible is the Word of God (John 1:1, Hebrew 4:12, 2.Timothy 3:16-17),
                            which we need to follow unconditionally and thus need to keep the commandment of Jesus
                            Christ (john 14:15, matthew 28:19). By following Him we glorify the Father through the works
                            he calls us to do( matthew 5:16). We believe that God’s given law in the old testament is
                            not eliminated (matthew 5:17).
                            Choosing the narrow way is keeping God’s commandments (matthew 7:13-14).
                            True repentance is essential in going the narrow road to heaven (matthew 4:17).<br>
                            We believe in the constitution of marriage between man and woman (matthew 19:4-6) and in the
                            life God created ( genesis 1:27, job 33:4, psalm 100:3, psalm 119:73, psalm 139 13-16,
                            isaiah 44:24)
                        </p>

                    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Our mission is to spread the Truth to the world and provide a new translation that is
                        leaned on the original. So that believers will have discernment and a better
                        understanding of the Word of God. <br>
                        <q>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge,
                            I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast
                            forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</q> (Hosea 4:6)

                        <h3>Our vision</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Our Vision is to see people get saved without going astray, when facing challenges. We
                            want to see believers mature in their faith and become one of God’s soldiers.
                            <q>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that
                                warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who
                                hath chosen him to be a soldier.
                            </q> (2 Timothy 2:3-4)

                <h3>Elena S. Johnsen</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>She was born in Thailand and grew up in Norway.
                    She is married and have three wonderful children
                    raised in Christian foundation.
                    Pastor Elena was a Christian early on in life.<br>
                    But she truly became a believer when life hits her
                    through an unexpected illness and that is when she decided to sincerely surrender
                    herself to the<br>
                    Lord Jesus Christ and follow his steps.
                    She then got a revelation from the Lord of founding a church
                    and obeyed.<br>
                    In 2022, when covid happened the Lord opened the way for the Way, the Truth & the Life Church.
                    In 2023, the Way, the Truth & the Life Church was
                    officially registered.<br>
                    Pastor Elena continuously learns about the Word of God and shares it with other believers.
                    She is a godly example of a believer, a wife and a mother.
