                <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
                <p>We are a small community of believers who fellowship and exchange the knowledge of God. We considered
                    as a family of God who takes care of each other. <br>We aim to provide true believers with the truth
                    found in the word of God.<br>
                    We fast and pray to receive the wisdom of God and transform into the person God intends us to be.
                    We are a registered church since 2023. As we don’t have an actual location yet and our members are from different countries and locations,
                    sermons are held online as of now.

                <h3 id="elena"><strong>Elena S. Johnsen</strong></h3><br>
                    <p>She was born in Thailand and raised&grew up in Norway. She is married to her husband Børge Johnsen.
                        They have three wonderful children raised in Christian foundation.
                        Pastor Elena was a Christian early on in life. But she truly became a believer when life hit her
                        through unexpected illness and that is when she decided to sincerely surrender herself to the Lord
                        Jesus Christ and follow his steps.
                        2022, when covid happened the way the truth and the life church was born. Process of becoming an
                        official church was taking a whole year and 2023 the way, the truth and the life church was
                        officially registered as a church.
                        We have mostly members with believers coming from Thailand and living in Europe (norway&germany).
                        Therefore the teachings are held in thai language. Other languages will follow in future.</p>                 </p>
